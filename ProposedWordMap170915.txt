* Where possible words are categorized as a Direct Logical Member of a Grouping.  Sometimes, in practice, it seems that there is a very
  close association between such as an Object and an Activity.  A Rugby Ball, rather than to belong to a group of "sports Objects" could
  be categorized directly under the RUGBY_Sport Word.  Perhaps the legitimacy and value of this categorization is more obvious for BottleNeck
  Associated directly under Bottle, rather than in a grouping of "Necks".  Visual cues will be given.

** Where this is an exploratory feature to test the feasibility of giving unique symbol names to each unique SubSymbol.  The actual features
based on this could be the highlighting / making active of all words containing a given key as a way of finding Symbols (very much as typing
a letter can work in searching algorithms).


//ALL KEYS TO BE Declared (Dart Language) SYMBOLS, quotes therefore unnecessary.  This may not make sense for the WORD sub part names...
