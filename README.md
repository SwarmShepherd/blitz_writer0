Exploratory Project for Bliss Symbols to Bridge Natural Languages

After exploring a heirarchtical system with a depth of up to 6 levels it was decided to attempt a two level system - in end effect.   EVERY WORD OF THE VOCABULARY SHALL BE ACCESSIBLE WITH 2 Keyboard/Mouse Events (such as click).  Never More.  Never Less.   If this works it will be SIMPLE.

While there are only two "hard" levels, there are actually at least 5 "soft", or visual levels beginning with the six major Groupings of the Highest Level Keys, henceforth refered to as SUPERKEYS.  See the file ScreenCapture0831.pdf  for a screen capture / first peek at the first peek from end of August, 2015.

Note that the Major Groupings are:

PEOPLE (the center of the Screen and in the same shape as the Bliss symbol for 'Man')
SCENES (to the right moving out, strongly involving PEOPLE in their various common activities)
ANIMATE (to the left of PEOPLE, moving outward involving Animals, Insects, and the animate things of our world
CONCEPTS far to the Right and gearing to the knowledgebase of a typical modern adult, Arithmetic, Physics...
WORLD to the far Left - The cold hard stuff of the Universe outside our direct experience such as Volcanoes..
LANGUAGE arcs over the entire screen providing the GLUE needed to express our thought



LANGUAGE also includes a Grouping named KEYS which provides a useful list of the entire set of BASE SYMBOLS

WE THINK THERE IS A SIMPLE TRICK TO UNDERSTANDING THE INDEX SCHEME USED.  We were all once Babies!  When a PERSON:BABY is born his/her world consists of the people he/she is dependent upon, Milk, and lots of loving care that involves such as POOP, PEE, and Soiled Diapers.  This is a little "Earthy", perhaps but it is also the shared basis for the human experience!  Accordingly Diapers, and the matters they contain, are at the very center of our screen, not just Right to Left, but also top to bottom.

As we mature, and our world grows and we leave our diapers we experience many things, we get to know parts of the home such as Doors, and the also very human matters of Food Preparation, we vist Zoos and learn of Animals...   all moving outward from birth to the much more abstract CONCEPTS of Mathematics, or the Objects to be found in WORLD:universe...

Associated with each SUPERKEY is a Grouping of words.   These words are organized by "SOFTABS" which are color indexed and serve as organizing Tabs.

NOTE:  Most words belong to a grouping for what should be pretty apparent reasons of logic.  HOWEVER some words, also visually marked, are there on the basis, not of logic, but of STRONG DIRECT ASSOCIATION.  If the SUPERKEY is PEOPLE:SPORTS and the SOFTAB is RUGEBY the Thing "Wicket" may be found here, NOT for the reason that it is a "SPORT" (which it is not) but because the word "Wicket" is strongly associated with Rugby.  Likewise some words are the logical OPPOSITE will also be included.

Many words, the majority of the words in my opinion, have found a clear SUPERKEY/SOFTKEY index position.  We have not been afraid to duplicate a key multiple times.

To see the more current DISTRIBUTION of the words, please review the file: superkey_groupings_stats.txt in the Root Directory.
