Exploratory Project for Bliss Symbols to Bridge Natural Languages

(Note: All documents such as about1.txt have been moved to the \docs sub-directory.)

After exploring a hierarchical system with a depth of up to 6 levels it was decided to attempt a two level system - in end effect.   EVERY WORD OF THE VOCABULARY SHALL BE ACCESSIBLE WITH 2 Keyboard/Mouse Events (such as click).  Never More.  Never Less.   If this works it will be SIMPLE.

While there are only two "hard" levels, there are actually at least 5 "soft", or visual levels beginning with the six major Groupings of the Highest Level Keys, henceforth referred to as SUPERKEYS.  See the file ScreenCapture0831.pdf  for a screen capture / first peek at the first peek from end of August, 2015.

Note that the Major Groupings are:

PEOPLE (the center of the Screen and in the same shape as the Bliss symbol for 'Man')
SCENES (to the right moving out, strongly involving PEOPLE in their various common activities)
ANIMATE (to the left of PEOPLE, moving outward involving Animals, Insects, and the animate things of our world
CONCEPTS far to the Right and gearing to the knowledgebase of a typical modern adult, Arithmetic, Physics...
WORLD to the far Left - The cold hard stuff of the Universe outside our direct experience such as Volcanoes..
LANGUAGE arcs over the entire screen providing the GLUE needed to express our thought



LANGUAGE also includes a Grouping named KEYS which provides a useful list of the entire set of BASE SYMBOLS

WE THINK THERE IS A SIMPLE TRICK TO UNDERSTANDING THE INDEX SCHEME USED.  We were all once Babies!  When a PERSON:BABY is born his/her world consists of the people he/she is dependent upon, Milk, and lots of loving care that involves such as POOP, PEE, and Soiled Diapers.  This is a little "Earthy", perhaps but it is also the shared basis for the human experience!  Accordingly Diapers, and the matters they contain, are at the very center of our screen, not just Right to Left, but also top to bottom.

As we mature, and our world grows and we leave our diapers we experience many things, we get to know parts of the home such as Doors, and the also very human matters of Food Preparation, we vist Zoos and learn of Animals...   all moving outward from birth to the much more abstract CONCEPTS of Mathematics, or the Objects to be found in WORLD:universe...

Associated with each SUPERKEY is a Grouping of words.   These words are organized by "SOFTABS" which are color indexed and serve as organizing Tabs.

NOTE:  Most words belong to a grouping for what should be pretty apparent reasons of logic.  HOWEVER some words, also visually marked, are there on the basis, not of logic, but of STRONG DIRECT ASSOCIATION.  If the SUPERKEY is PEOPLE:SPORTS and the SOFTAB is RUGEBY the Thing "Wicket" may be found here, NOT for the reason that it is a "SPORT" (which it is not) but because the word "Wicket" is strongly associated with Rugby.  Likewise some words are the logical OPPOSITE will also be included.

Many words, the majority of the words in my opinion, have found a clear SUPERKEY/SOFTKEY index position.  We have not been afraid to duplicate a key multiple times.

To see the more current DISTRIBUTION of the words, please review the file: superkey_groupings_stats.txt in the Root Directory.




VERSION 0.1 NOTES!

    Over 5,000 words have recently been categorized.  The Categorization is ROUGH, and there are many levels of
    refinement before the groupings will be anything like finalized for eventual publication!

    The initial goal is to test the feasibility of a 2 Key system.

    The SIX SUPERKEY GROUPINGS have not needed changes.

    Note that the word groups such as Articles and Prepositions have been distributed into the LANGUAGE group.

    Many Features such as "favorites" and more will just be missing, as they are unnecessary for the initial evaluations.

    The Number of SUPERKEYS have expanded, and some have been modified over the last week. Perfectly distributed
    Groupings would all have 60 Words... Realistic TARGET number of words is greater than 40 and less than 80 Some
    groupings have less than the desired number of Words More than 20 Groupings have more than the desired number of
    Words SOFTABS help organize the the Grouping Screens

    The Groupings had to evolve naturally, but as they evolved a number of words otherwise categorized could easily better
    fit in the new category.

    Redundancies have been allowed, although they are 'wasteful', under certain circumstances.

    Some words have simply not made sense to the author, or may have been misunderstood

    Very Little effort has been spent organizing the words in their SUPERKEY groupings.  Many refinements to come!  The author, for
    example, special color and shape modifications in mind for OPPOSITES.

    A refinement to use closely associated words seems to be working, however, as things have evolved it is possible that words
    already categorized may have not have been re-categorized in consistency with the new word.

    IN SHORT, WE ARE AWARE THAT MANY TYPES OF ERRORS EXIST, early reviews should be done with the preliminary nature of version 0.1
    in mind.
